## Tidyverse, a universe of material

The [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)  is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

There exists tons of books, websites, blogs and many other soruces for learning how to use this amazing packages. I say amazing, because these has made my coding life much easyer, and helped me a lot in introducing studnets with no computer science background to programming for data science. 

Here, a collection of my favourite materials for learning it. Everything is online and FREE. The material is grouped by kind of source and i will keep it updated as new material will come out.
