In the first lesson we will talk about the __importance of programming for competitive and strategic intelligence__, with a particular focus on the possible programming languages available.

Then, since in this course you will learn how to use R, we will introduce this programming language. For this reason i ask you to:

- Go to the R project page (https://cran.r-project.org/) _and download and install the r-version compatible with your system_;

- Go to the R Studio page (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and _download and install the R studio IDE_;

- Open R studio and, using the console window at the bottom left, _install the tidyverse packages_ using the instruction at the following page (https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/).

If you have any question please contact me on the Slack. 

See you tomorrow!

Filippo
