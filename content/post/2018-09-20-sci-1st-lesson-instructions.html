<p>In the first lesson we will talk about the <strong>importance of programming for competitive and strategic intelligence</strong>, with a particular focus on the possible programming languages available.</p>
<p>Since in this course you will learn how to use R, we will introduce this programming language. For this reason i ask you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the R project page (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>) <em>and download and install the r-version compatible with your system</em>;</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the R Studio page (<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>) and <em>download and install the R studio IDE</em>;</p></li>
<li><p>Open R studio and, using the console window at the bottom left, <em>install the tidyverse packages</em> using the instruction at the following page (<a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/" class="uri">https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any question please contact me on the Slack.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
