      <description>&lt;p&gt;Text mining techniques are being adopted in many fields to face the problem of extracting meaningful information hidden in unstructured data. Hybrid processes (human-machine) of knowledge extraction are usually the best solution. Anyway, state-of-art literature on Natural Language Processing (NLP) lacks in process management studies: research did not focuses yet on ways to integrate NLP outputs and human activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and my resarch team focus our research on information extraction from texts for developing &lt;strong&gt;technical lexicons&lt;/strong&gt;. Our knowledge base integrates many entities (e.g. users, technologies, advantages, disadvantages, skills and knowledges). Our onjective is to create a standardized knowledge base of innovation, using bottom-up and top-down approaches. Such a knowledge base, in combination with state of the art techniques of NLP, will drammatically foster the performances of Artificial Intelligence Systems in the context of technical documents analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
